# ThunderGod's Forecast (Weather App)

Demo: http://niravtech.com/projects/javascript/weather/

This project utilizes the free version of OpenWeather API to get weather data. The free version only allows searches by City name only. Results can be returned in either Metric or Imperial units.

I utilize the ES6 JavaScript class feature to create each object of the page and put them together. The page is compiled into a single JavaScript file using WebPack.
